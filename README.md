What is the function of photo editing software? Photo editing software is used to manipulate or enhance digital images. This category of software ranges from basic apps, which are able to apply simple effects, to industry-standard programs used by professional photographers for more advanced needs.

In this project (Image Editor in JavaScript), as youâ€™ve seen in the preview image, users can apply different filters to their image like grayscale, inversion, saturation, and adjust the image brightness. Additionally, users can also rotate or flip the images and save their edited images.
